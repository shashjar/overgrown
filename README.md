## Overview
Overgrown is a solution to the common problem of cluttered, mismanaged tabs in a long browsing session; rather than letting unused tabs sit in a browser collecting dust Overgrown encourages pruning discarded tabs like one would prune a bonsai tree. The more tabs that accumulate in a browsing session, the more that vines, bamboo, or other growths crowd the user's screen!


## Features
- **Procedurally generated** animations for plant growth throughout a browsing session
- Local storage functionality for keeping track of tabs opened + closed
- User metrics for tab counts throughout both a 24-hour time period and for the entire duration the extension has been installed
- 4 selectable plant types, 3 selectable growth speeds
- Published to the Chrome Store!

## Challenges & Achievements
Aside from the ever-present difficulty of creating an idea itself, our biggest challenge was smoothly and elegantly animating the plant growths throughout a browsing session, as well as utilizing Chrome's local storage functionality for keeping track of tab metrics. As a team, we're extremely proud of how our project turned out as a deployment-ready product! 


## What's Next
Potential room for expansion includes:
- Different animation/texture styles for plants
- More plant and growth types
- Further tab manager functionality (tab grouping, tap pinning) within the extension itself
- Enhanced tracking for unused tabs during a browsing session.
